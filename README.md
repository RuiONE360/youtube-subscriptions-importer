### youtube-subscriptions-importer

Import youtube subscriptions to your youtube channel!

Ever have to change google accounts?  Ever had to re-add all of your youtube subscriptions manually?  
I have had to do one of these things, and it isn't the latter.  Now you can re-subscribe to all of your
youtube channels with the simple click of a button!  Or just simply import them to another channel.
